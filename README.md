# VPN-Experiment-Report
This project explores how free VPN services protect user privacy and secure internet traffic. It includes a practical test of a VPN connection, IP masking verification, encrypted traffic validation, and speed comparison before and after VPN use. The project also summarizes key VPN benefits and limitations, with screenshots and documented findings.

## Objective
- Test a free VPN service
- Verify IP masking and encryption
- Compare browsing speed before and after VPN
- Summarize VPN benefits and limitations

##  Steps Performed
1. Chose and signed up for a free VPN (e.g., Proton VPN)
2. Installed the VPN client and connected to a server
3. Verified IP change using whatismyipaddress.com
4. Checked encrypted traffic and browsing functionality
5. Compared browsing speed with and without VPN
6. Researched VPN encryption protocols and privacy features
7. Documented key findings and screenshots

## Key Findings
- VPN successfully masked IP address
- Browsing was secure and functional with encrypted traffic
- Slight drop in speed observed
- VPNs improve privacy but have some limitations

##  Files Included
- `screenshots/` – Before and after IP screenshots
- `vpn-summary.pdf` – Summary of benefits and limitations
- `speedtest-results.md` – Speed test comparison
